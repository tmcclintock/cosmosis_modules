# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    r_min: "real, minimum radius being calculated in units of Mpc/h"
    r_max: "real, maximum radius being calculated in units of Mpc/h"
    num_r: "real, number of radii spaced logarithmically between r_min and r_max"

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:

outputs:
    setup_delta_sigma:
        radii: "1D real array, location of all radii that DeltaSigma(R) will be evaluated at."
