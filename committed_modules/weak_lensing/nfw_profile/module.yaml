rules:
    "This requires that a redshift sample, z, has been generated beforehand."

    - "http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9508025"

assumptions:
    - "Virialized halo created from gravitational collapse."
    - "If used for, e.g., DeltaSigma(R) analysis then mass bins should match those from the module setup_delta_sigma."
    - "Uses scale radius instead of concentration."

explanation: >
    "The NFW density profile describes the density of a virialized halo at a
    given redshift assuming a spherical gravitational collapse model.

    This profile changes as a function of the virial mass (M200) and
    the characteristic scale radius (r_scale) at which the logarithmic slope
    of the density profile is d log(rho)/d log(r) = -2.

params:
    delta: "real, overdensity or mean interior density relative to baryon background"
    r_min: "real, minimum radius to calculate the profile at in units of Mpc/h"
    r_max: "real, maximum radius to calculate the profile at in units of Mpc/h"
    num_r: "integer, number of radii to calculate the profile at"

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
inputs:
    cosmological_parameters:
        hubble: "real, Hubble constant today in units of km/s/Mpc"
        omega_m: "real, matter density fraction today"
