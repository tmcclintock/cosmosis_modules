explanation: >
    "Tinker et al. 2010 calculated a halo bias as a function of mass and overdensity (Delta).
     This bias is then applied, e.g., to a matter-matter correlation function to arrive at a halo-matter
     correlation function."

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    delta: "real, overdensity or mean interior density relative to baryon background"

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
inputs:
    cosmological_parameters:
        hubble: "real, Hubble today in units of km/s/Mpc/100"
        omega_m: "real, matter density fraction today"
        log10_cluster_mass: "real, log_10 of the mass of the halo"
        
    matter_power_lin:
        k_h: "real 1D array, sample values of linear power spectrum in Mpc/h"
        z: "real 1D array, redshift of linear power spectrum samples"
        p_k: "real 2D array, linear powe spectrum in (Mpc/h)^{-3}"

outputs:
    tinker_bias:
        bias: "real 1D array, bias calcalated at each redshift"
        sigma2m: "real 1D array, linear matter variance at each redshift"
