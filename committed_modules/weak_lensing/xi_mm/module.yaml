purpose: "Computes the matter-matter correlation function."

rules:
    - "Parallelized with OpenMP. Benefits greatly from multiple threads."

assumptions:
    - "Radial bins have already been created through the module setup_delta_sigma."

explanation: 
    "The matter-matter correlation function is just the 3D Fourier transform of the power
     spectrum. Assuming spherical symmetry, this reduces to a radial integral over all k."

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    matter_power: "string, the matter power spectrum to be integrated (e.g. matter_power_lin or matter_power_nl)."

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
inputs:
    matter_power_XXX:
        k_h: "real 1D array, sample values of linear power spectrum in Mpc/h"
        z: "real 1D array, redshift of linear power spectrum samples"
        p_k: "real 2D array, linear powe spectrum in (Mpc/h)^{-3}"
    setup_delta_sigma:
        radii: "1D real array, location of all radii that DeltaSigma(R) will be evaluated at."

outputs:
    xi_mm:
        xi_mm: "real 2D array, matter-matter correlation function at each radial bin for all redshift samples. If there is only a single redshift sample then this is a 1D array."
