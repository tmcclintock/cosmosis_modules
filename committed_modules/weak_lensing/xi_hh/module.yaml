assumptions:
    - "Requires a bias and xi_{mm} to be calculated first."

explanation: >
    "The halo-halo correlation function is simply 
    \xi_{hh} = b(z,M)^2*\xi_{mm}."

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    bias: "String, the name of the bias used (e.g. tinker)"

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
inputs:
    ${bias}_bias:
        bias: "real 2D array, bias calculated at each radial bin for all redshift samples"
   
    xi_mm:
        xi_mm: "real 2D array, matter-matter correlation function for all redshift samples at each radii"
        
outputs:
    xi_hh:
        xi_hh: "2D real array, 2 halo-halo correlation function at each radii at each sample redshift. If only one redshift sample is given then this is a 1D real array."
