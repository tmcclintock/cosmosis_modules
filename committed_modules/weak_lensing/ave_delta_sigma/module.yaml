name: ave_delta_sigma
version: October 9 2015
purpose: "Computes the average surface over density, bar{DeltaSigma}, within some radial bins."

assumptions:
    - "DeltaSigma(R) has been computed previously over a range at least as large as the range of radial bins used here."

explanation: 
    - "This takes an average of the over density within logarithmically spaced radial bins. For a given radial bin {R_1,R_2}, this is given by: bar{DeltaSigma(R_1,R_2} = frac{2*int_{R_1}^{R_2} R*DeltaSigma(R)dR}{R_2^2 - R_1^2}."

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    bin_min: "real, minimum bin edge in units of Mpc/h"
    bin_max: "real, maximum bin edge in units of Mpc/h"
    num_bins: "integer, number of radial bins"

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
inputs:
    delta_sigma:
        delta_sigma:  "real 2D array, surface over density in units of M_odot h/pc^2 at previously specified radii for all redshift samples"
    distances:
        z: "real 1D array, redshifts of samples"
    setup_delta_sigma:
        radii: "1D real array, location of all radii that DeltaSigma(R) will be evaluated at."

outputs:
    ave_delta_sigma:
        bin_edges: "real 1D array, edges of the radial bins. Note: this is num_r+1 in length."
        ave_delta_sigma: "real 2D array, surface over density in units of M_odot h/pc^2 within each radial bin."
