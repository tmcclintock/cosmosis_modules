name: xi_1halo
version: October 9 2015
purpose: "Computes the 1 halo correlation function."

rules:
    "This requires that a density profile has been calcualted previously."

assumptions:
    - "Works with the comoving matter density."

explanation: >
    "The 1 halo correlation function is simply 
    \xi_{1h} = \frac{\rho_{profile}}{\rho_m} - 1."

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    profile_name: "string, the prefix name (e.x. nfw) of the halo profile being used"

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
inputs:
    cosmological_parameters:
        hubble: "real, Hubble today in units of km/s/Mpc/100"
        omega_m: "real, matter density fraction today"
    setup_delta_sigma:
        radii: "1D real array, location of all radii that DeltaSigma(R) will be evaluated at."
    ${profile_name}_profile: 
        rho_${profile_name}: "real 2D array, density of sample at each radii at each sample redshift in units of SM/Mpc^3"
        
outputs:
    xi_1halo:
        xi_1halo: "2D real array, 1 halo correlation function at each radii at each sample redshift."
