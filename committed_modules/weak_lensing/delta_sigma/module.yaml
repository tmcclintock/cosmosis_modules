assumptions:
    - "Below the minimum radius of the input correlation function an analytic NFW profile is used."

explanation: 
    - "Calculating the surface over density is an integral out to R: DeltaSigma(R) = frac{2}{R^2} int_{0}^{R} r_p Sigma(sqrt(R^2 + r_p^2)) dr_p - Sigma(R). A cubic spline is used to fit the Sigma(R) in order to calculate the mean surface density interior to R (i.e. the term on the left of the RHS). Note: the redshift samples come from the distance field (i.e. from CAMB) instead of from Halofit. This is because it doesn't actually matter the ordering of the redshifts, we just care about how many there are (len(z). The ordering of the samples here corresponds to that of halofit, i.e. low z to high z, while CAMB is the reverse of this"
