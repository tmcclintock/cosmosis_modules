# cosmosis_modules
Modules committed (or in progress) to the cosmosis repo. This also includes the demo directory with the demos I have made.

Finished modules are in committed_modules/. Uncommitted modules are in working_modules/. Modules that have been committed but are being worked on will appear in both, with committed_modules/ containing the most recently committed modules, and working_modules/ containing the most recent work done.
